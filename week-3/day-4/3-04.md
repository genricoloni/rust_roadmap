## Concise Control Flow with `if let` and `let else`

### `if let`

In Rust, you can use the `if let` syntax to handle a pattern match in a more concise way. This is particularly useful when you are only interested in one pattern and want to ignore the others. For example, consider the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);

    match some_u8_value {
        Some(3) => println!("three"),
        _ => (),
    }
}
```

The `match` statement above is a bit verbose: we are only interested in the `Some(3)` pattern, and we have to explicitly handle the other cases. We can rewrite this code using `if let`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);

    if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
        println!("three");
    }
}
```

The `if let` syntax allows us to match a single pattern and execute code if the pattern matches. If the pattern does not match, the code block is skipped. This is a more concise way to handle pattern matching when you are only interested in one case. However, this syntax allows us to use an `else` block to handle the non-matching case:

```rust
fn main() {
    let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);

    if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
        println!("three");
    } else {
        println!("not three");
    }
}
```

### `let else`

In addition to `if let`, Rust also provides the `let else` syntax to handle the non-matching case. This syntax allows you to bind the value to a variable if the pattern matches, and execute code if the pattern does not match. For example:

```rust
fn describe_ten_cents(coin: Cash) {
    let state = if let Cash::ten_cents (state) = coin {
        state
    } else {
        return None;
    };

    println!("Ten cents with state: {:?}", state);
```

The `let else` syntax allows you to bind the value to a variable if the pattern matches, and execute code if the pattern does not match, leading to less verbose code:

```rust
fn describe_ten_cents(coin: Cash) {
    let Cash::ten_cents(state) = coin else {
        return None;
    };

    println!("Ten cents with state: {:?}", state);
```

## Patterns and Matching

Patterns are a special syntax used in Rust to match against the structure of types, both complex and simple.

### Where Patterns Can Be Used

Patterns pervade Rust code, appearing in many places where you might not know they are patterns. Here are some examples:

- `match` arms
- `if let` expressions
- `while let` expressions
- `for` loops
- `let` statements
- Function parameters

### (Ir)refutable Patterns

Patterns can be either **refutable** or **irrefutable**. An **irrefutable pattern** is one that will match for any possible value, and it is used in:

- `let` statements
- Function parameters
- `for` loops

This is the reason behind this code:

```rust
let Some(x) = some_option_value;
```

will not compile: `Some(x)` is a refutable pattern, and the compiler will not allow it to be used in an irrefutable context, forcing you to handle every possible case, to guarantee that the pattern will always match.

```rust
if let Some(x) = some_option_value {
    println!("x is {}", x);
}
```

However, if we use an `if let` expression when the pattern is irrefutable, the compiler will give a warning, but the code will compile:

```rust
if let x = 5 {
    println!("x is {}", x);
}
```

```bash
warning: irrefutable `if let` pattern
 --> src/main.rs:2:8
  |
2 |     if let x = 5 {
  |        ^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: this pattern will always match, so the `if let` is useless
  = help: consider replacing the `if let` with a `let`
  = note: `#[warn(irrefutable_let_patterns)]` on by default

warning: `patterns` (bin "patterns") generated 1 warning

```

## Pattern Syntax

### Matching variables

The simplest matching is the one against a variable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1 => println!("one"),
        2 => println!("two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        4 => println!("four"),
        5 => println!("five"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
}
```

### Matching named variables

Named variables are irrefutable patterns, and they can be used to bind the value to a variable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);

    match x {
        Some(5) => println!("five"),
        Some(y) => println!("y is {}", y),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
}

println!("at the end: x is {x:?, y is {y:?}");
```

In the code above, the `Some(y)` pattern will match any `Some` value, and bind the inner value to the variable `y`. The print statement at the end will show that `x` is still `Some(5)`, and `y` is the inner value `5`.

### Matching multiple patterns

You can match multiple patterns in a single arm by using the `|` operator:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1 | 2 | 3 => println!("one, two, or three"),
        4 | 5 | 6 => println!("four, five, or six"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
}
```

The `|` operator allows you to match multiple patterns in a single arm, making your code more concise and readable.

### Matching ranges with `..=`

You can also match ranges of values using the `..=` operator:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1..=5 => println!("one through five"),
        _ => println!("something else"),

    }
}
```

This syntax can also be used with characters:

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'c';

    match c {
        'a'..='z' => println!("lowercase letter"),
        'A'..='Z' => println!("uppercase letter"),
        _ => println!("not a letter"),
    }
}
```

The `..=` operator allows you to match ranges of values, making your code more concise and readable.

## Destructuring complex types

Patterns can be used to destructure complex types, such as tuples and structs.

### Structs

You can destructure a struct using a pattern that matches the struct's fields:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("x is {}, y is on the x-axis", x),
        Point { x: 0, y } => println!("x is on the y-axis, y is {}", y),
        Point { x, y } => println!("x is {}, y is {}", x, y),
    }
}
```

In the code above, we destructure the `Point` struct using patterns that match the `x` and `y` fields. We can also use patterns to match specific values of the fields, as shown in the examples above.

### Enums

You can destructure an enum using patterns that match the enum's variants:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);

    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("The message is Quit"),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("The message is Move to ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("The message is Write '{}'", text),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("The message is ChangeColor to RGB({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
    }
}
```

In the code above, we destructure the `Message` enum using patterns that match the enum's variants. We can also destructure the `Move` variant to access the `x` and `y` fields; for those variants without fields, we can simply match the variant name.

### Nested structs and enums

You can destructure nested structs and enums using patterns that match the nested fields and variants:

```rust
enum Color {
    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),
    Hsv(i32, i32, i32),
}

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(Color),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(0, 160, 255));

    match msg {
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(r, g, b)) => println!("The message is ChangeColor to RGB({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(h, s, v)) => println!("The message is ChangeColor to HSV({}, {}, {})", h, s, v),
        _ => println!("The message is something else"),
    }
}
```

## Ignoring values in patterns

### Ignoring values with `_`

Another usage of the `_` wildcard is to also ignore values in function parameters:

```rust
fn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("y is {}", y);
}

fn main() {
    foo(5, 10);
}
```

### Nested `_` patterns

You can also use the `_` wildcard to ignore parts of a pattern:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut setting_value = Some(5);
    let new_setting_value = Some(10);

    match (setting_value, new_setting_value) {
        (Some(_), Some(_)) => {
            println!("Can't overwrite an existing customized value");
        }
        _ => {
            setting_value = new_setting_value;
        }
    }
```

In case both `setting_value` and `new_setting_value` are `Some`, we want to print a message and not overwrite the value. In all other cases, we want to overwrite the value.

Another example is when you want to ignore some fields of a tuple:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

    match numbers {
        (first, _, _, _, last) => {
            println!("The first number is {} and the last number is {}", first, last);
        }
    }
}
```

### Ignoring unused variables with `_`

In Rust, creating a variable that is never used will trigger a warning. To avoid this, you can use the `_` wildcard to ignore the variable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let _y = 10;

    println!("x is {}", x);
}
```

Note that prefixing a variable with an underscore does not prevent it from being assigned a value; it only suppresses the warning about the variable being unused.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = Some(String::from("hello"));

    if let Some(_s) = s {
        println!("found a string");
    }

    println!("{:?}", s);
}
```

The code above will receive an error because we're consuming the `s` variable by assigning it to `_s`, and using it in the `println!` macro.

This code, instead, will compile:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = Some(String::from("hello"));

    if let Some(_) = s {
        println!("found a string");
    }

    println!("{:?}", s);
}
```

In this case, we have not moved the value of `s` into `_`, so we can still use `s` after the `if let` block.


### Ignoring remining values with `..`

You can use the `..` operator to ignore the remaining values in a pattern:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
    z: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7, z: 0 };

    match p {
        Point { x, .. } => println!("x is {}", x),
    }
}
```

An equivalent, more verbose way to write the code above would be:

```rust
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7, z: 0 };

    match p {
        Point { x, y: _, z: _ } => println!("x is {}", x),
    }
}
```

We can use this syntax to rewrite the example from the [previous section](#nested-_-patterns):

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

    match numbers {
        (first, .., last) => {
            println!("The first number is {} and the last number is {}", first, last);
        }
    }
}
```

Strange enough, the following code will not compile:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

    match numbers {
        (.., second, ..) => {
            println!("The second number is {}", second);
        }
    }
}
```

The error message is:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling patterns v0.1.0 (file:///projects/patterns)
error: `..` can only be used once per tuple pattern
 --> src/main.rs:5:22
  |
5 |         (.., second, ..) => {
  |          --          ^^ can only be used once per tuple pattern
  |          |
  |          previously used here

error: could not compile `patterns` (bin "patterns") due to 1 previous error
```

It's impossible for Rust to know which values to ignore when you use `..` more than once in a pattern. This is why the compiler will not allow it.

## Extra conditionals with Match Guards

You can add extra conditions to match arms using match guards:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    
    match x {
        Some(x) if x % 2 == 0 => println!("x is even"),
        Some(x) => println!("x is odd"), 
        None => println!("x is not a number"),
    }
}
```

The main drawback of match guards is that the compiler doesn't check if the condition is exhaustive. This means that you can write a match guard that will never be true, and the compiler will not warn you about it.

### `@` binding

This operator allows us to create a variable that holds a value that matches a pattern, and then use that variable in the match guard:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    
    match x {
        x @ 0..=10 => println!("x is {:?}", x),
        _ => println!("Another one")
    }
}
```

In the code above, the `0..=10` pattern will match any value between 0 and 10, and bind that value to the variable `x` by the means of the `@` operator. We can then use `x` in the match guard to print that value.
