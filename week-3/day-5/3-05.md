# Day 15 - Rust Roadmap

## Rust ToDoList Exercise (Simplified)

We want an abstract data type called ToDoList that manages a set of tasks. Each task has:

- A description (string, up to 40 characters).
- A priority (an integer ≥ 1). Lower numbers mean higher urgency.
- A done status: either “done” or “not done.”

Below are the requirements and operations you must implement in Rust.

### Data Structure

You can define something like:

    struct Task {
        description: String,
        priority: u32,
        done: bool,
        // possibly track insertion order if needed
    }

    struct ToDoList {
        tasks: Vec<Task>,
        // any extra fields if needed
    }

### Operations

#### Constructor

`fn new() -> Self;`

Creates an empty ToDoList.

#### Add a Task

`fn add_task(&mut self, description: &str, priority: u32) -> Result<(), String>;`

    Inserts a new task with the given description (≤ 40 chars) and priority (≥ 1).
    Mark it as not done initially.
    Return an error if the description is too long or the priority is invalid.
    The newly added task should maintain its insertion order so that tasks with the same priority appear in the order they were inserted.

#### Print

`fn print(&self);`

    A method that prints all tasks to standard output (e.g. using println!).
    Sort tasks by ascending priority, then by the order in which they were inserted.
    Use a format such as:

      1 - Buy groceries
    V 2 - Call Bob
      2 - Another task
      3 - Something else

    where tasks that are done are prefixed by V , and not-done tasks by two spaces.

#### Merge

`fn merge(&mut self, other: &ToDoList);`

    Copy every task from other into self, preserving each task’s description and priority, but force them to be marked “not done” in self.
    Keep the same insertion order for these newly added tasks relative to each other, but they appear after the existing tasks that are already in self.

#### Mark as Done

`fn mark_done(&mut self, description: &str);`

    Finds the first task (when sorted/printed) that has the given description and is not done, then mark it as done.
    If no such task is found, do nothing.

#### Remove Done Tasks

`fn remove_done(&mut self);`

    Removes all tasks whose done == true from the ToDoList.

### Example Usage / Output (Suggested)

Here’s a simplified version of potential output (you’re free to format it differently, as long as the ordering rules and “done vs. not done” marker are clear):

```txt
--- FIRST PART ---
Test constructor and add_task
  1 - Task3
  2 - Task1
  2 - Task2
  2 - Task5
  3 - Task4

--- SECOND PART ---
Test merge
  1 - Task3
  1 - Task1
  2 - Task1
  2 - Task2
  2 - Task5
  2 - Task2
  3 - Task4
  3 - Task3
  4 - Task4

Test mark_done
  1 - Task3
V 1 - Task1
  2 - Task1
V 2 - Task2
  2 - Task5
V 2 - Task2
  3 - Task4
  3 - Task3
  4 - Task4

Test remove_done
  1 - Task3
  2 - Task1
  2 - Task5
  3 - Task4
  3 - Task3
  4 - Task4

```

(This example shows tasks being added, then merging tasks from a second list, marking some as done, then removing done tasks. Ordering is always ascending by priority, then insertion order. A “V ” indicates done, while two spaces indicate not done.)
Sample [main.rs](exercises-day-5/src/main.rs) file for testing your solution.

### Implementation Notes

You may return Result or Option in add_task if the description is too long or priority < 1.
In print(), sort tasks by (priority, insertion_index) to maintain consistent ordering.
In merge(), copy tasks from other but reset their done field to false. They should appear after existing tasks in self if they share the same priority.
