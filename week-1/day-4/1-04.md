# Day 4 - Rust Roadmap

Today, no theory! I suggest to get your hands dirty by implementing the exercise "Guessing Game" from the Rust Book. It's a good way to practice what you've learned so far.

The walkthrough is available in the book at the following link: [Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

## Interesting stuff found during the exercise

- library `rand::Rng` to generate random numbers
- library `std::cmp::Ordering` can be used to compare values
- function `trim()` must be called on the input to remove the newline character
- function `parse()` is used to convert a string to a number
- assigning an integer to a variable can be made with `match` to handle the `Result` type and avoid panics
- Syntax for assigning a variable with `match`:

    ```rust
    let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => continue,
    };
    ```

- `match` can be seen as a `switch` statement in other languages; its syntax is `match value { pattern => expression, pattern1 => expression1, ... }`
