## Introduction to channels

Channels are a way to communicate between threads in Rust. They allow you to send messages from one thread to another, enabling synchronization and coordination between threads. Rust provides a built-in channel implementation in the `std::sync::mpsc` module (multiple producer, single consumer). This paradigm can be summarized by the Go's slogan: **Do not communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating**.

### Creating a channel

To create a channel, you can use the `mpsc::channel` function, which returns a tuple containing a sender and a receiver.respectively used to send and receive messages. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("Hello from the thread!");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Received: {}", received);
}
```

### Ownership among channels

Sending data through a channel transfers ownership of the data from the sender to the receiver. This means that once the data is sent, it cannot be used in the sender thread anymore. In the example above, the `String` value is moved into the channel when `tx.send(val)` is called, and it cannot be accessed in the thread after that point.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("Hello from the thread!");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });

    // This line will cause a compile-time error because `val` has been moved
    println!("Value: {}", val);
}
```

Even in this case, Rust's ownership rules prevent to compile an incorrect code, preventing runtime errors.

### Sending multiple messages

We can also send multiple messages through a channel. The receiver will receive the messages in the order they were sent. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..5 {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
        }
    });

    for received in rx {
        println!("Received: {}", received);
    }
}
```

In this case, we haven't used the `recv` method: we can indeed use `rx` as an iterator, which will receive messages until the sender is dropped. The `for` loop will automatically handle the iteration and print each received message.

### Enabling multiple producers

Recalling the `mpsc` acronym, we can have multiple producers sending messages to a single consumer. This can be done by **cloning the sender**. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    let tx1 = tx.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("hi"),
            String::from("from"),
            String::from("the"),
            String::from("thread"),
        ];

        for val in vals {
            tx1.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("more"),
            String::from("messages"),
            String::from("for"),
            String::from("you"),
        ];

        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });

    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {received}");
    }
}
```

In this example, we create two threads that send messages to the same receiver. The `tx.clone()` method creates a new sender that can be used in the second thread trough the same channel. The receiver will receive messages from both threads in the order they are sent. The `for` loop will print each received message, regardless the sender.
