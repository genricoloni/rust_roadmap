## Lifetime

Lifetime is a concept in Rust that helps the compiler to ensure that references are valid for a certain period of time. The compiler uses lifetime annotations to determine how long references are valid: if the compiler can't determine the lifetime of a reference, it will throw an error. In fact, lifetime has been implemented mainly to **prevent dangling references**.

Consider the following example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;
    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }
    println!("r: {}", r);
}
```

As we already know, `x`'s scope is limited to the inner block, so when we try to print `r`, the compiler will throw an error because `r` is a reference to `x`, which is no longer valid. The thrown error will be:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0597]: `x` does not live long enough
 --> src/main.rs:6:13
  |
5 |         let x = 5;
  |             - binding `x` declared here
6 |         r = &x;
  |             ^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
7 |     }
  |     - `x` dropped here while still borrowed
8 |
9 |     println!("r: {r}");
  |                  --- borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error
```

Line `x does not live long enough` suggests us that the error is somehow related to the concept of lifetime: we define lifetime as the time a variable is valid. A variable *live longer* than another if its scope is wider. In the example above, `x`'s scope is limited to the inner block, so it doesn't live long enough for `r` to be valid. **Borrow checker** is used by Rust compiler to perform these checks.

### Borrow Checker

Borrow checker is a part of the Rust compiler that checks references' validity by looking at their scopes.

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                          //          |
    {                     //          |
        let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
        r = &x;           //  |       |
    }                     // -+       |
                          //          |
    println!("r: {r}");   //          |
}                         // ---------+
```

We refer to the lifetime of `x` as `'b` and the lifetime of `r` as `'a`, and we can clearly see that `'b` is shorter than `'a`. The borrow checker will throw an error because `r` is a reference to `x`, and `x`'s lifetime is shorter than `r`'s lifetime.

On the other hand, the following code will compile successfully:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                          //           |
    let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                          //   |       |
    println!("r: {r}");   //   |       |
                          // --+       |
}                         // ----------+
```

Recalling the rules on references: `r` end its scope after the `println!` call, because it is the last time it is used, while `x`'s scope is the entire `main` function. The borrow checker will not throw an error because `r`'s lifetime is shorter than `x`'s lifetime. In general, this is the strategy used by the borrow checker to determine the validity of references, always ensuring each reference is valid when used.

## Generic lifetimes in functions

When you write a function like longest that returns a reference, Rust wants to know how long that returned reference will stay valid. If the function returns one of its parameters (for example, either x or y), the compiler needs to be sure that whichever reference is returned won’t be used after the data it points to has gone out of scope. But in the code:

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

we haven’t told Rust anything about the relationship between x’s lifetime and y’s lifetime. The compiler doesn’t know whether x or y will live longer, and it doesn’t know which one is returned. Consequently, Rust complains that the function’s return type needs a named lifetime parameter.

By adding a **generic lifetime parameter** (like 'a) to x, y, and the return type, we’re basically telling Rust that **whichever slice I return won't outlive either slice `x` or `y`, because the returned slice will be valid for almost the same time as the input slices**.

We can now write the function as follows:

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

where `'a` is a generic lifetime parameter. This way, Rust will know that the returned reference will be valid for the same time as the input references. This satisfies the borrow checker, because it now knows exactly how long the references will be valid.

### Syntax for lifetime annotations

It is worth to remember that **lifetime annotations don't change how long references live**; they simply describe the relationships between lifetimes of multiple references. The syntax is the following:

```rust
&i32       // a reference
&'a i32    // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32// a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
```

### Syntax in function signature

When our function returns a reference, the compiler wants to know how long that returned reference is valid. If the function can return a reference to either x or y, Rust needs to ensure that whichever one is chosen won’t become invalid too soon.

By placing a **generic lifetime parameter** (usually named 'a) in the angle brackets, like this:

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    // ...
}
```

the compiler will know that the returned reference will not outlive the input references. That means `longest` only compiles if the references we pass in (and the reference it returns) all live long enough for Rust to be certain they’re valid.

By specifying `'a` for both `x` and `y`, and also for the return type, you tell Rust:

- Both `x` and 'y` must be valid for at least `'a` time.
- The returned reference is valid for `'a` time as well, so it’s valid only if both references passed in remain valid.

In practice, Rust will figure out that **`'a` is as large as the shorter of the two input lifetimes**. We’re not changing how long each string actually lives – we’re just making sure the compiler knows that the returned reference cannot outlive its inputs.

### Some examples

Have a look at the following example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");

    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
        println!("The longest string is {result}");
    }
}
```

- `string1` is valid for the entire `main` function
- `string2` is valid only for the inner block
- `result` is a reference returned by `longest` which must not outlive `string1` and `string2`

Since `string2` will be dropped at the end of the inner block, `result` will not outlive `string2`, but given that we're using it whithin the inner block, where `string2` is still valid, the code will compile successfully.

If instead we'd try to use `result` outside the inner block, the code would not compile:

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    println!("The longest string is {result}");
}
```

In this situation, `result` would outlive `string2`, which is not allowed by the borrow checker.

### Tips for lifetimes in functions

Lifetimes annotations are strictly dependent on the function's behavior. In a function like the following:

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
    x
}
```

even if we've specified lifetime `'a` only for `x` and the return type, code will compile anyway because `y`'s lifetime doesn't have any relationship neither with `x` nor with the return type. In this case, Rust will infer that `'a` is the same as `y`'s lifetime.

Another case is when we return a lifetime that is not related to any of the input, but only to a local variable:

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
    let result = String::from("long string is long");
    result.as_str()
}
```

This code will not compile because `result`'s lifetime is not related to `x` and `y`, and Rust will not be able to infer the lifetime of the returned reference. The specific error will be:

```shell
error[E0515]: cannot return value referencing local variable `result`
  --> src/main.rs:11:5
   |
11 |     result.as_str()
   |     ------^^^^^^^^^
   |     |
   |     returns a value referencing data owned by the current function
   |     `result` is borrowed here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0515`.
```

This fails to compile because `result` goes out of scope at the end of the function. Trying to return `result.as_str()` would give the caller a reference to memory that no longer exists. Rust doesn’t allow that: the compiler prevents us from returning references to data that’s cleaned up once the function exits.

When we really want to create a new string (or any new data) inside a function and pass it back to the caller, we should return an owned type (like String) rather than a reference. That way, the caller takes ownership of the data and is responsible for dropping it later. For example:

```rust
fn make_long_string() -> String {
    String::from("really long string")
}
```

Now it’s perfectly fine to return the new `String` — no lifetimes needed here for references, because you’re returning an owned value.

## Lifetime elision rules

In older versions of Rust (before 1.0), every reference needed an explicit lifetime annotation. But the Rust team noticed that in certain common patterns, the lifetime could be inferred. So they added lifetime elision rules to let the compiler fill in missing lifetimes automatically in specific, predictable cases.

### The rules

The lifetime elision rules are a set of three rules that the Rust compiler uses to determine the lifetime of references in function signatures. The last rule involves methods, which are functions that are associated with a struct or an enum: we'll see them in the next chapters, but for know it's enough to know that works like classes' methods in other languages.

These rules, in order, are:

1. For **every** reference parameter, the compiler assigns a different lifetime parameter:
   - For a single reference parameter, the lifetime will be `'a`
   - For multiple reference parameters, the lifetimes will be `'a`, `'b`, `'c`, and so on
2. If a function has one reference parameter, the lifetime of the return value is the same as the lifetime of the reference parameter
3. If there are multiple reference parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self` (a method), the lifetime of the return value is the same as the lifetime of `self`

If the compiler can't infer the lifetimes of references using these rules, it will throw an error. In this case, we need to add explicit lifetime annotations.

### Examples

Let's consider the following function:

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
```

We can try to apply the elision rules to this function:

1. The function has one reference parameter, so we assign the lifetime `'a` to it, obtaining `fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str`
2. The second rule applies, so the return value's lifetime is the same as the reference parameter's lifetime, resulting in `fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str`
3. We have already inferred the lifetimes, so we don't need to apply the third rule

The final function signature is `fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str`, which is the same as the original function signature. The compiler will be able to infer the lifetimes of references using the elision rules, so we don't need to add explicit lifetime annotations.

Let's consider another example:

```rust
fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {
```

1. The function has two reference parameters, so we assign the lifetimes `'a` and `'b` to them, obtaining `fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str`
2. The function has multiple reference parameters, so we don't apply the second rule
3. The function doesn't have a method, so we don't apply the third rule

After applying the elision rules, the function signature is `fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str`: thus, the compiler is not able to infer the lifetimes of references using the elision rules, and we need to add explicit lifetime annotations.

## The `'static` lifetime

The `'static` lifetime is a special case in Rust indicating that a reference can live for the entire duration of the program. Every string literal is, by definition, `'static`, because the text is stored in the compiled binary and remains available until the program ends. For example, you can explicitly annotate a string literal as &`'static` str, although this is usually inferred automatically.

When the compiler suggests using `'static` for a reference, it’s crucial to verify whether that reference really does or should exist throughout the whole program’s runtime. Often, such suggestions appear when there’s a mismatch between available lifetimes or a risk of creating a dangling reference. In those situations, rather than forcing `'static`, the correct approach is to ensure that references do not outlive the data they point to. Using `'static` casually can hide deeper lifetime issues and should generally be reserved for data that truly must outlive everything else in the program.
