## Tips and tricks for more advanced `match` usage

The `match` keyword is a powerful tool in Rust, and it can be used in many different ways. In the following sections, we will explore some of the more advanced features of `match`.

### Matching multiple patterns

In the previous examples, we have seen how to match a single pattern. However, it is also possible to match multiple patterns using the `|` operator. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1 | 2 | 3 => println!("One, two, or three"),
        4 | 5 | 6 => println!("Four, five, or six"),
        _ => println!("Something else"),
    }
}
```

The usage is trivial: we just need to separate the patterns with the `|` operator. This is useful when we want to group similar patterns together.

### `if` guards

A **guard** is an additional condition that must be satisfied for a pattern to match. Guards are introduced by the `if` keyword, followed by a boolean expression. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 7;

    match x {
        v if v % 2 == 0 => println!("Even number"),
        _ => println!("Odd number"),
    }
}

```

We can also use the `if` guard with multiple patterns:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = false;

    match x {
        1 | 2 | 3 if y => println!("One, two, or three and y is true"),
        1 | 2 | 3 if !y => println!("One, two, or three and y is false"),
        _ => println!("Something else"),
    }
}
```

### Deconstructing tuples

For those functions that return a tuple (ore even when dealing with `struct`s or `enum`s), we can destructure the tuple directly in the `match` statement. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (x, y) = get_coordinates();     // not defined here, but you get the idea

    match (x, y) {
        (0, 0) => println!("Origin"),
        (0, y) => println!("Y-axis"),
        (x, 0) => println!("X-axis"),
        (x, y) => println!("({},{})", x, y),
    }
}
```

### `Option` and `Result` types

In Rust, values that might or might not exist or that can succeed or fail are typically wrapped in special *container* types rather than using null pointers or exceptions. Two of the most common patterns are:

- `Option<T>`: represents an optional value of type T.
      - `Some(x)` means there is a value (x).
      - `None` means there is no value.

    When you have an `Option<T>`, you must handle both cases (`Some` and `None`), and this is usually done with `match` cases or the `if let` syntax.

- `Result<T, E>`: Represents either a successful value of type `T` or an error of type `E`.
      - `Ok(x)` means the operation succeeded and gives you `x`.
      - `Err(e)` means the operation failed and provides an error value e explaining why it failed.
    When you have a `Result<T, E>`, you typically use a `match` or the `?` operator to handle both success `Ok` and error `Err` cases.

For example:

```rust
fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    if y == 0 {
        return Err("Division by zero".to_string());
    }
    Ok(x / y)
}

fn main() {
    let result = divide(10, 2);
    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
```

Dealing with `Some(val)`, we can write:

```rust
fn fun_returning_option() -> Option<i32> {
    Some(42)
}

fn main() {
    let maybe_value = fun_returning_option();
    match maybe_value {
        Some(val) => println!("Got {}", val),
        None => println!("No value"),
    }
}
```

## Exercises

### Vowel or consonant - Easy

- Write a function `fn classify_char(c: char) -> &'static str` that matches on a single character.
- Return "vowel" if `c` is one of `a, e, i, o, u` (lowercase only). 
- Return "consonant" if it’s any other alphabetic char, and "other" otherwise.

### Merge two sorted slices - Medium

- Write a function `fn merge_sorted(a: &[i32], b: &[i32]) -> Vec<i32>` that takes two sorted slices and returns a new sorted `Vec<i32>` containing all elements from both slices.
- You cannot modify the input slices in-place; create a merged vector.

### Two sum - Medium

Even if the problem is considered easy, solving it in Rust, expecially in case knowlege of the language is not deep, can be a bit tricky. Full track on [LeeCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### Mini expression evaluation - Hard

- Define an `enum Expr` that can hold:
      - A number
      - An addition of two sub-expressions
      - A multiplication of two sub-expressions

- Write a function `evaluate(expr: &Expr) -> i32` that uses match to recursively evaluate the expression.

You can use this `main` function to test your implementation:

```rust
fn main() {
    use Expr::*;
    let expr = Add(
        Box::new(Mul(Box::new(Number(2)), Box::new(Number(3)))),
        Box::new(Number(5)),
    );
    
    match evaluate(&expr) {
        11 => println!("Correct!"),
        _ => println!("Incorrect!"),
    }

    let expr = Mul(
        Box::new(Add(Box::new(Number(2)), Box::new(Number(3)))),
        Box::new(Number(5)),
    );

    match evaluate(&expr) {
        25 => println!("Correct!"),
        _ => println!("Incorrect!"),
    }
} 
```

### In-place rotations - Hard

- Write a function fn rotate_in_place(data: &mut [i32], k: usize) that rotates the slice by k positions to the right.
      - Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] rotated by 2 → [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
- You must do it in place without allocating a new array.
