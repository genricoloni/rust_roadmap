## References and Borrowing

Let's look back at the snippet from the [previous day](../day-1/2-01.md#return-values-and-scope):

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();
    let s2 = String::from("hello");
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);

    println!("s1 = {}, s3 = {}", s1, s3); // prints "s1 = hello, s3 = hello"
}

fn gives_ownership() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(s: String) -> String {
    s
}
```

The pattern of creating a new variable for the return value is a bit cumbersome: for this very reason, Rust has a feature called **references**. References allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it. Using the `&` symbol, you can create a reference to a value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

Referencing a variable allows a function to access it without taking ownership; in this way, at the end of the function's scope, the variable is still available for further use, because that function was not its owner. This is called **borrowing**. Note that the scope of a reference starts when it is declared and ends the last time it is used.

### Modify a reference

What if we want to modify the value that a reference points to? Look at the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&s);

    println!("{}", s); 
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

This code will not compile, because we are trying to modify a borrowed value: by default, references are immutable. To make a reference mutable, you can use the `&mut` syntax:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);

    println!("{}", s); // prints "hello, world"
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

One important rule about **mutable references** is that you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. The following code will not compile:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
}
```

The error message will be:

```shell
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |              ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 |
7 |     println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
  |                        -- first borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0499`.
error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error
```

This rule exists to prevent **data races**, which are very similar to **race conditions** and are notoriously difficult to debug. Rust's type system prevents this kind of error at compile time, which is a huge advantage over other languages.

Note that we can use the curly braces to create a new scope, allowing us to create the *illusion* of having multiple mutable references, since the first references will be dropped at the end of the scope:

```rust
fn main() {
    
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
}
```

### Mutability vs Immutability

Another forbidden pattern is having a mutable reference and an immutable reference to the same data in the same scope:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```

This code will not compile, and the error message will be:

```shell
4 |     let r1 = &s; // no problem
  |              -- immutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &s; // no problem
6 |     let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
  |              ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 |     println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
  |                                -- immutable borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error
```

This rule exists because whoever has an immutable reference to a variable assumes that the variable will not change, and this cannot be guaranteed if there is a mutable reference to the same variable. 

However, mutable references are allowed once the previous immutable references are no longer in scope:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::

    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;
    
    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2); //from here on, r1 and r2 are no used anymore

    let r3 = &mut s;
    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

Given that `r1` and `r2` are no longer used after the `println!` macro, their scope ends there, allowing us to create a mutable reference to `s` without any problems.

## Dandling References

A **dangling reference** is a reference that points to a memory location that has already been deallocated, like in this example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
}
```

It can be tricky to understand why this code will not compile, so let's break it down:

1. Inside the `dangle` function, we create a new `String` variable called `s`.
2. We create a reference to `s`
3. We return the reference to `s`
4. The function ends, thus the variable `s` goes out of scope, forcing the compiler to call the `drop` function to free the memory

At this point, in the `main` function, we would have a reference `reference_to_nothing` that that refers to something that has already been deallocated. Rust prevents this kind of error by not allowing the creation of dangling references. A solution to this problem is to return the `String` itself, instead of a reference to it: in that way, the ownership of the variable is transferred to the calling function, so the variable's scope will not end at the end of the function.

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = no_dangle();

} // here ends the scope of reference_to_nothing

fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s // ownership of s is transferred to the calling function
}
```

## Exercises

I suggest you to implement the exercises from [yesterday](../day-1/2-01.md#exercises) using references and borrowing. This will help you to understand the concepts better.

Furthermore, you can try to implement the following exercises:

- [Medium] Write a function that receives a reference to a `String` and returns a new `String` with words in reverse order. For example, if the input is `"hello world"`, the output should be `"world hello"`.
- [Hard] Write a function that receives a reference to a `Vec<i32>` and removes all the duplicates from it, maintaining the order of the elements. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4]`, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
