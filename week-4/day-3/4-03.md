## Fundamentals on OOP in Rust

Although it doesn't exists a formal definition of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. We refer to objects as entities that have **data** fields (attributes), and associated procedures known as **methods**. Objects can interact with one another to design applications and computer programs. Rust doesn't explicitly supports objects, but it offers features such as `structs` and `enums` which can be used to implement OOP concepts. For this very reason, we can say that Rust is an Object-Oriented Language.

### Encapsulation

Another feature of OOP is **encapsulation**. Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, and allows access to the object's internal state only through the object's methods. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them. In Rust, we can use `structs` to encapsulate data and methods by specifying the visibility of the fields and methods.
Let's see an example:

```rust
pub struct AveragedCollection {
    list: Vec<i32>,
    average: f64,
}
```

We have defined a `struct` named `AveragedCollection` with two fields: `list` and `average`. The `list` field is a `Vec<i32>` that stores a list of integers, and the `average` field is a `f64` that stores the average of the integers in the list. Given that we have not specified the `pub` keyword before the fields, they are private by default. This means that the fields can only be accessed within the module where the `struct` is defined. To allow access to the fields from outside the module, we need to specify the `pub` keyword before the fields. Let's add some methods to the `AveragedCollection` `struct`:

```rust

impl AveragedCollection {
    pub fn new() -> AveragedCollection {
        AveragedCollection {
            list: Vec::new(),
            average: 0.0,
        }
    }

    pub fn add(&mut self, value: i32) {
        self.list.push(value);
        self.update_average();
    }

    pub fn remove(&mut self) -> Option<i32> {
        let result = self.list.pop();
        match result {
            Some(value) => {
                self.update_average();
                Some(value)
            }
            None => None,
        }
    }

    pub fn average(&self) -> f64 {
        self.average
    }

    fn update_average(&mut self) {
        let total: i32 = self.list.iter().sum();
        self.average = total as f64 / self.list.len() as f64;
    }
}
```

We have defined an `impl` block for the `AveragedCollection` `struct` that contains the implementation of the methods. Most of them are public, being the API trough which we can access the `AveragedCollection` `struct`. We can also not4e that the last one, `update_average`, is private. This means that it can only be accessed within the module where the `struct` is defined. The `update_average` method is used to update the average of the integers in the list whenever a new integer is added or removed.

This implementation allow us to modify, if necessary, the internal representation of the `AveragedCollection` `struct` without affecting the external code that uses it: this is the essence of encapsulation, thus Rust effectively supports this OOP concept.

### Inheritance

Another important feature of OOP is **inheritance**. Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Inheritance allows us to define a new class that is based on an existing class. The new class is known as a **subclass** or **derived class**, and the existing class is known as a **superclass** or **base class**. Inheritance allows us to **reuse the code** of the existing class and extend it to add new features. Rust doesn't support inheritance in the traditional sense, but it provides a feature called **traits** that can be used to achieve similar functionality. Traits allow us to define a set of methods that a type must implement in order to use the trait. We can then implement the trait for a type, which allows the type to use the methods defined in the trait.

## Trait objects for different types

Rust allows a (limited) code reuse through the use of trait objects: similarly to a parent class in OOP, which implements a method that can be inherited by its children, a trait object allows us to define a pre-defined implementation for its methods. In this way, any type that implements the trait can use the methods defined in the trait object, and also override them if necessary.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Rust, polymorphism can be achieved through the use of **generics** with **trait bounds**, obtaining an **bounded parametric polymorphism**. This means that we can define a function that works with any type that implements a specific trait. This allows us to write code that is more generic and reusable, since it can work with any type that implements the trait.

Suppose we want a small GUI toolkit where each component can draw itself. In Rust, we can represent this shared behavior through a **trait**. For example, we might define a `Draw` trait with one method called `draw`:

```rust
pub trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}
```

Any type that implements `Draw` must provide a `draw` method, which is how that type knows how to present itself onscreen. Once we have this trait, we can store many different concrete types in a collection as trait objects. A trait object is a pointer (like `Box<dyn Draw>`) that holds both the value and information about which method to call at runtime.

### Storing trait objects

Imagine we have a struct Screen that collects our drawable components:

```rust
pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}
```

Each element in components can be any type, as long as it implements Draw. In other words, each element is a *trait object* of type `Box<dyn Draw>`.

To use the trait object, we define a run method that just calls draw on every component:

```rust
impl Screen {
    pub fn run(&self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we don’t need to know exactly which concrete type each component is; we only require that each implements the `Draw` trait.

As a concrete example, suppose we define a `Button` that has width, height, and label fields. We can implement `Draw` for `Button`:

```rust
pub struct Button {
    pub width: u32,
    pub height: u32,
    pub label: String,
}

impl Draw for Button {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to draw a button...
    }
}
```

Similarly, someone else might define a `SelectBox` that also implements `Draw`:

```rust
struct SelectBox {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
    options: Vec<String>,
}

impl Draw for SelectBox {
    fn draw(&self) {
        // code to draw a select box...
    }
}
```

We can then create a Screen containing both a SelectBox and a Button:

```rust
fn main() {
    let screen = Screen {
        components: vec![
            Box::new(SelectBox {
                width: 75,
                height: 10,
                options: vec![
                    String::from("Yes"),
                    String::from("Maybe"),
                    String::from("No"),
                ],
            }),
            Box::new(Button {
                width: 50,
                height: 10,
                label: String::from("OK"),
            }),
        ],
    };

    screen.run();
}
```

When we call `screen.run()`, each `Box<dyn Draw>` in the vector has its draw method invoked, whether it’s a `SelectBox` or a `Button`. This means we can **combine types freely** as long as they share the `Draw` trait.

## Why Use Trait Objects?

If we had used generics with a trait bound (like `Screen<T: Draw> { components: Vec<T> }`), all components in that `Vec<T>` would have to be the same concrete type. By contrast, using a trait object (`Box<dyn Draw>`) allows different concrete types in the same collection, so `Screen` can hold various UI elements. The trade-off is that trait objects use dynamic dispatch at runtime, which can introduce a small performance cost, but it gains flexibility.

If we try to store a type that doesn’t implement `Draw`, the compiler would reject that code. Here’s an error message if we tried `Box::new(String::from("Hi"))`:

```bash
the trait bound `String: Draw` is not satisfied
```

This prevents us from accidentally calling methods that don’t exist on a type. In this way, Rust’s type system ensures correctness without requiring manual checks at runtime.

Overall, trait objects let us write code that focuses on the behavior we need (like calling draw) instead of the specific type implementing that behavior. This pattern is sometimes compared to **duck typing**, except that Rust enforces these rules at compile time to keep our programs safe and consistent.
