## Generics

Generics are a way to abstract over types. They allow you to write code that can work with any type.

### Generic Functions

Rust allow us to define functions with a generic type parameter. Assume we have two functions that return the maximum from a list of integers and characters:

```rust
fn max_int(list: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut max = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > max {
            max = item;
        }
    }
    max
}

fn max_char(list: &[char]) -> char {
    let mut max = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > max {
            max = item;
        }
    }
    max
}
```

We can see that the two functions are almost identical. The only difference is the type of the list parameter. We can use generics to write a single function that works with any type:

```rust
fn max_generic<T>(list: &[T]) -> T {
    let mut max = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > max {
            max = item;
        }
    }
    max
}
```

The `T` in `max_generic<T>` is a type parameter: it allows us to define a function that works with *almost* any type. The `<T>`'s usage is just a convention, since types should have short names with upper camel case: being a single letter, and the initial letter of the type name, it is easy to identify it as a type parameter.

In reality, this code won't compile and we need to add a constraint to the type parameter:

```rust
fn max_generic<T: PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> T {
    let mut max = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > max {
            max = item;
        }
    }
    max
}
```

The `T: PartialOrd` constraint means that the type `T` must implement the `PartialOrd` trait: we'll extensively cover traits the next day.

### Structs with Generics

We can also define structs with generic type parameters. For example, we can define a `Point` struct that can hold any type of data:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let int_point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    let float_point = Point { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 };
}
```

However, if we try to create a `Point` with different types, the code won't compile, because the `x` and `y` fields must have the same type. To fix this, we can define multiple type parameters:

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let int_float_point = Point { x: 1, y: 2.0 };
    let float_int_point = Point { x: 1.0, y: 2 };
    let mixed_point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
}
```

In any case, it is not suggested to use many type parameters in a struct, as it can make the code harder to read and understand.

### Enums with Generics

The same rules seen for structs apply to enums. Note how we already used a generic enum in the previous day:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}

enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

In `Result`, `T` is the type of the value in case of success, and `E` is the type of the error in case of failure. In `Option`, `T` is the type of the value in case of success, and `None` is used to represent the absence of a value.

Recalling the examples from the previous days

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
}
```

The `File::open` function returns a `Result<File, std::io::Error>`, thus binding `T` to `File` and `E` to `std::io::Error`.

### Methods with Generics

We can also define methods with generic type parameters. For example, we can define a method that returns the value of a `Point`:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}
```

It is also possible to define methods for specific types, unavailable for other types:

```rust
impl Point<f64> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f64 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

In this case, the `distance_from_origin` method is only available for `Point<f64>` instances.

It is also possible to define methods with multiple type parameters:

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

impl<T, U> Point<T, U> {
    fn mixup<V, W>(self, other: Point<V, W>) -> Point<T, W> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);
    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y); // p3.x = 5, p3.y = c
}
```

## Performance of Generics

Generics are a great tool for writing reusable code, and they come completely penalty-free in Rust, since types are resolved at compile time. This means that the generated code is as efficient as if we had written it for a specific type. This operation is called **monomorphization**, and it is a key feature of Rust's generics.
