## `RefCell` and the Interior Mutability Pattern

**Interior mutability** is a design pattern in Rust that allows us to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data. To mutate data, the pattern uses unsafe code inside a safe abstraction.

### `RefCell<T>`

Unlike `Rc`, `RefCell` represents single ownership over the data it holds, and it differs from `Box` in that it enforces the borrowing rules at runtime. This has been implemented because Rust compiler is *conservative*: if it can't prove that our code is safe only by reading it, it will reject it, but it can happens that we know that our code respects borrowing rules even if the compiler can't prove it. In this case, we can use `RefCell` to wrap our data and enforce borrowing rules at runtime: if we break them, the program will panic.

### Differences between `RefCell` and `Rc`

- `Rc` allows multiple owners of the same data; `RefCell` and `Box` have single owners.
- `Box` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc` allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
- We can mutate the value inside a `RefCell` even when we have an immutable reference to it, which is impossible with `Rc` and `Box`.

## Use case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects

### Overview

In testing, we might replace a real component with a **test double**, a type that mimics the interface of the real component but only for testing purposes. A **mock object** is a specific kind of test double that can record which methods were called so we can verify that our code is doing what we expect. In Rust, we can create a struct to act as our mock object and implement the same trait as the real component would.

Here, we have a library that tracks some `value` against a maximum (`max`) and warns when the `value` crosses certain thresholds. The library doesn’t send out alerts itself; instead, it depends on a type implementing a `Messenger` trait:

```rust
pub trait Messenger {
    fn send(&self, msg: &str);
}

pub struct LimitTracker<'a, T: Messenger> {
    messenger: &'a T,
    value: usize,
    max: usize,
}

impl<'a, T> LimitTracker<'a, T>
where
    T: Messenger,
{
    pub fn new(messenger: &'a T, max: usize) -> LimitTracker<'a, T> {
        LimitTracker {
            messenger,
            value: 0,
            max,
        }
    }

    pub fn set_value(&mut self, value: usize) {
        self.value = value;

        let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;

        if percentage_of_max >= 1.0 {
            self.messenger.send("Error: You are over your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.9 {
            self.messenger
                .send("Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.75 {
            self.messenger
                .send("Warning: You've used up over 75% of your quota!");
        }
    }
}
```

LimitTracker calls `.send` on any Messenger it’s given, but it doesn’t actually define how messages are delivered. This allows different applications to decide whether to send emails, texts, or something else.

### The need for a mock object

We want to test that calling `set_value` with different values indeed triggers the correct warning messages. We’ll build a mock type that simply records any messages it’s asked to send:

```rust
struct MockMessenger {
    sent_messages: Vec<String>,
}

impl MockMessenger {
    fn new() -> MockMessenger {
        MockMessenger {
            sent_messages: vec![],
        }
    }
}

impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        // Attempt to store message in sent_messages
        self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message)); // ERROR
    }
}
```

However, the problem is that `send` takes `&self`, an immutable reference, which means we cannot mutate the struct’s internal `sent_messages` vector. Changing the `Messenger` trait to accept `&mut self` might affect other code. So we need another approach that respects the original Messenger definition.

### Switching to Interior Mutability with `RefCell<T>`

Rust provides **interior mutability** to let us modify data even when us only have an immutable reference to the container, as long as us respect borrowing rules at runtime. We do this using `RefCell<T>`:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct MockMessenger {
    sent_messages: RefCell<Vec<String>>,
}

impl MockMessenger {
    fn new() -> MockMessenger {
        MockMessenger {
            sent_messages: RefCell::new(vec![]),
        }
    }
}

impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        // Borrow the inner Vec<String> mutably at runtime
        self.sent_messages.borrow_mut().push(String::from(message));
    }
}
```

Here, `sent_messages` is a `RefCell<Vec<String>>`. Even though `send` takes an immutable reference to `self`, we can call .`borrow_mut()` on the `RefCell` to get a mutable reference to the vector. This is allowed because `RefCell<T>` enforces Rust’s borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time. If we violate them (for instance, having two active mutable borrows at once), our code will panic at runtime.

### Testing the Behavior

When we test `LimitTracker`, we can use `MockMessenger` to verify the correct messages are logged:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
    let mock_messenger = MockMessenger::new();
    let mut limit_tracker = LimitTracker::new(&mock_messenger, 100);

    limit_tracker.set_value(80);

    // borrow() gives an immutable reference to the inner Vec<String>
    assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.borrow().len(), 1);
}
```

Since 80 is 80% of 100, the `LimitTracker` calls .send with a warning. We confirm by checking if `mock_messenger.sent_messages` has exactly one entry.

By combining trait-based design with interior mutability via `RefCell<T>`, we can test code that expects an immutable reference to a messaging component but still needs to track mutable state in our mock. This pattern allows us to keep the `Messenger` trait flexible (still using `&self`) while enabling the mock to record data about calls in a controlled way. As a result, we can verify that our library sends the correct notifications without changing the library’s public API.

## Reference cycles can leak memory

Although Rust enforces many compile-time checks to ensure memory safety, it does **not** guarantee protection against all memory leaks. It is possible to create a **reference cycle**, in which two or more values contain references to each other, increasing their reference counts so that they can never be dropped. This scenario can occur when using types like `Rc<T>` combined with interior mutability (`RefCell<T>`). Even though it doesn’t violate Rust’s safety guarantees, a reference cycle means our program will never deallocate those values, resulting in a memory leak.

### Creating a reference cycle

Consider the following **`List`** enum, which uses an `Rc<List>` inside a `RefCell` to allow us to mutate the pointer in a cons cell:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),
    Nil,
}

impl List {
    fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {
        match self {
            List::Cons(_, item) => Some(item),
            List::Nil => None,
        }
    }
}
```

Here, each `Cons` variant can hold an integer and a mutable reference (`RefCell`) to an `Rc<List>`. The tail method helps us see the second item in the list.

In the snippet below, we build two lists, `a` and `b`, then update `a` to refer to `b`, resulting in a cycle:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(List::Cons(5, RefCell::new(Rc::new(List::Nil))));
    println!("a initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());

    let b = Rc::new(List::Cons(10, RefCell::new(Rc::clone(&a))));
    println!("a rc count after b creation = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("b initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("b next item = {:?}", b.tail());

    // Now make `a` point to `b`
    if let Some(link) = a.tail() {
        *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);
    }

    println!("b rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("a rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));

    // Uncommenting the next line will cause a stack overflow due to infinite cycle
    // println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
}
```

When we run this code, the reference counts of both `a` and `b` end up at `2`. After `b` goes out of scope, its reference count goes from `2` to `1` (not zero). Similarly, `a` also ends with a reference count of `1`. The memory remains allocated since neither reference count drops to zero. This forms a cycle `a -> b -> a -> b -> ...` that will never be deallocated, leading to a memory leak. No pointer actually becomes invalid, but Rust never frees this memory because each `Rc` instance believes there is still at least one strong reference alive.

### Consequences

A small example like this ends quickly, so the memory leak is inconsequential. But in a real-world application, reference cycles can accumulate large amounts of memory and never release it, degrading performance or exhausting system resources.

Rust can’t automatically detect such cycles at compile time. It treats them as logic bugs that we must handle by carefully designing data structures.

### Breaking Cycles with `Weak<T>`

One way to avoid cycles is to ensure some of the references do not imply ownership. Instead of storing only strong references (`Rc<T>`), we can store weak references (`Weak<T>`) in certain links. A `Weak<T>` pointer does not increase the reference count of the target. Its “weak count” doesn’t prevent dropping the data; if all strong counts (`Rc`) go to zero, the data is freed even if weak counts remain.

When we need access to the underlying data, we call `.upgrade()` on a `Weak<T>`, which returns an `Option<Rc<T>>`. That `Option` is `None` if the data has been dropped, or `Some` if it’s still around. Using `Weak<T>` carefully ensures that once there are no more strong references, the value is freed, eliminating the cycle.

### Example on List or Graph

In many list-like or graph-like structures, we might have parent-child relationships. Typically, parents own children with `Rc<T>` references, but children keep a `Weak<T>` pointer back to the parent. This design ensures no cyclical strong references.

If we must combine `Rc<T>` with `RefCell<T>` for interior mutability, think carefully about when to clone an `Rc<T>` and when to use `Weak<T>`. Always confirm we not inadvertently forming a cycle.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
}
```
