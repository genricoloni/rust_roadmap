## Smart Pointers

Smart pointers are data structures that act like pointers but also have additional metadata and capabilities. They are useful because they can provide additional functionality beyond that of a regular pointer. Rust provides several smart pointers in the standard library, such as `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc`.

### `Box<T>`

The most common smart pointer is `Box<T>`, which allows us to store data on the heap rather than the stack. This is useful when we need to allocate memory at runtime or when we have a large amount of data that we want to store but don't know the size at compile time. An useful example is when we want to create a recursive data structure, such as a *cons list*:

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}
```

In this example, `List` is a tuple enum that can be either a `Cons` variant, which contains an `i32` and another `List`, or a `Nil` variant, which represents the end of the list. However, this definition is problematic because it is recursive: the size of `List` is not known at compile time, so Rust cannot determine how much space to allocate for it on the stack.

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)

error: could not compile `cons-list` (bin "cons-list") due to 2 previous errors
```

To solve this problem, as suggested by the compiler,  we can use a `Box` to store the `List` on the heap:

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}
```

Doing that, we're storing only the `Box` on the stack, which is allowed since it has a known size. The actual `List` data is stored on the heap, and the `Box` points to it. This way, we can create a recursive data structure without worrying about the size of the data at compile time.

We then can declare a `List` like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let list = List::Cons(1,
        Box::new(List::Cons(2,
            Box::new(List::Cons(3,
                Box::new(List::Nil))))));
}
```

The two main advantages of using `Box` are:

- no performance penalty: the data is stored on the heap, but the pointer is stored on the stack, so the performance is similar to storing the data on the stack;
- implementing the `Drop` trait: when a `Box` goes out of scope, the `Drop` trait is called, which allows us to clean up resources when the `Box` is no longer needed.

## `Deref` Trait

The `Deref` trait allows we to customize the behavior of the dereference operator `*`. This is useful when we want to create a smart pointer that behaves like a regular reference but also has additional functionality. For example, we can implement the `Deref` trait for a smart pointer to allow it to be used like a regular reference. To show capabilities of `Deref` trait, let's create a `MyBox` struct, which is a simpler yet similar version of `Box` (the behavior of `Box` is implemented using `Deref` trait as this example will show):

```rust
struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}
```

Trying to use `MyBox` as a regular reference, we get an error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = MyBox::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling deref-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/deref-example)
error[E0614]: type `MyBox<{integer}>` cannot be dereferenced
  --> src/main.rs:14:19
   |
14 |     assert_eq!(5, *y);
   |                   ^^

error: could not compile `deref-example` (bin "deref-example") due to 1 previous error
```

Our `MyBox<T>` type can’t be dereferenced because we haven’t implemented that ability on our type. To enable dereferencing with the * operator, we implement the Deref trait:

```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        &self.0
    }
}
```

For this specific implementation, we simply want to access to the value inside `MyBox`, and given that it is the first element of the tuple, we return a reference to it. Behind the scene, Rust is changing `*y` into `*(y.deref())`: this way, we can use `MyBox` as a regular reference.

## Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods

Rust uses deref coercion to convert a type into a reference to another type. This is useful when we want to pass a value of one type to a function that expects a reference to another type. For example, we can use deref coercion to pass a `MyBox<T>` to a function that expects a `&T`. Rust will automatically dereference the `MyBox<T>` to a `&T` so that it can be passed to the function. This is a convenient feature that allows we to write more flexible code without having to explicitly dereference values.

```rust
fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&m); // Hello, Rust!
}
```

Thanks to this mechanism, we don't have to add `&` to `m` when calling `hello` function: Rust automatically dereferences `m` to `&String` and then to `&str`. This would be the equivalent of calling `hello(&(*m)[..])`.

Furthermore, this conversion in done at compile time, by using `Deref::deref` method as many times as necessary to get a reference to the type that is expected, resulting in zero runtime cost.

### Deref Coercion and Mutability

Deref coercion also works with mutable references, because it is always possible to coerce a mutable reference into an immutable one. In particular, these conversions are possible:

- from `&T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`;
- from `&mut T` to `&mut U` when `T: DerefMut<Target=U>`;
- from `&mut T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`.

This means that if we have a mutable reference to a type that implements `Deref`, we can pass it to a function that expects an immutable reference to the dereferenced type. Note that the reverse is not possible: we cannot pass an immutable reference to a function that expects a mutable reference, as per the borrowing rules.

## Cleanup with `Drop` trait

We already know that Rust has a mechanism to clean up resources when a value goes out of scope: the `Drop` trait. This trait has one method, `drop`, that is automatically called when a value goes out of scope. We can use this trait to perform cleanup operations, such as closing a file or releasing memory, when a value is no longer needed.

```rust
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`!", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("my stuff"),
    };
    let d = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("other stuff"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointers created.");
}
```

In this example, we define a `CustomSmartPointer` struct that contains a `String`. We implement the `Drop` trait for `CustomSmartPointer` and print a message when the value is dropped. When we create two `CustomSmartPointer` values and print a message, we see that the `drop` method is called when the values go out of scope:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling drop-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/drop-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.60s
     Running `target/debug/drop-example`
CustomSmartPointers created.
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `other stuff`!
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `my stuff`!
```

### Early Drop

We can also call the `drop` method manually by using the `std::mem::drop` function. This can be useful when we want to clean up resources early, before a value goes out of scope. For example, we can use `drop` to close a file or release memory when we no longer need it.

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("some data"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    drop(c);
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```

Note that we can't call `drop` method directly on a value (doing `c.drop()` would result in a compile error), because it would be a conflict with the automatic cleanup mechanism, leading to a *double free* error. Instead, we use the `std::mem::drop` function to call the `drop` method manually.

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling drop-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/drop-example)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.73s
     Running `target/debug/drop-example`
CustomSmartPointer created.
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `some data`!
CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.
```

## `Rc<T>`, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer

For some structures, it is useful to have multiple ownership: for example, in a graph, a node can have multiple children, and each child can have multiple parents. In Rust, we can use the `Rc<T>` smart pointer to enable multiple ownership of a value. The `Rc<T>` type keeps track of the number of references to a value and automatically cleans up the value when the last reference is dropped.

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}
```

We are obliged to use `Rc` instead of `Box` because we need to have multiple ownership of the `List` values:

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let a = Cons(5, Box::new(Cons(10, Box::new(Nil))));
    let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
    let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
}
```

The value `a` is moved when we try to use it in `c`, because `Box` does not implement the `Copy` trait. This is not a problem with `Rc`, because it keeps track of the number of references to a value and does not move the value when we clone it.

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`
  --> src/main.rs:11:30
   |
9  |     let a = Cons(5, Box::new(Cons(10, Box::new(Nil))));
   |         - move occurs because `a` has type `List`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
10 |     let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
   |                              - value moved here
11 |     let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
   |                              ^ value used here after move

```

### Increasing Reference Count

Every time we call `Rc::clone`, the reference count of the `Rc` value is increased by one. When the reference count drops to zero, the value is cleaned up. This is a safe way to have multiple ownership of a value, because the value is only cleaned up when it is no longer needed.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    println!("count after creating a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!("count after creating b = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!("count after creating c = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    }
    println!("count after c goes out of scope = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45s
     Running `target/debug/cons-list`
count after creating a = 1
count after creating b = 2
count after creating c = 3
count after c goes out of scope = 2
```

Note that we cannot explicitly see the counter drop to zero, because it will happen when the `Rc` values go out of scope outside of the `main` function.

The `Rc<T>` has also a `weak_count` method, which has a different behavior, but its existence is the reason why the method to get the strong count is called `strong_count` and not just `count`.
